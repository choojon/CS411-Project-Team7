## Idea 1 >> Travel planning website

Create a travel planning website that helps users plan and book their trips. The platform could include features such as travel guides, destination reviews, booking tools, and itinerary planning tools. The site could generate revenue through advertising, affiliate marketing, or commission on bookings.

## Idea 2 >> Group calander (Google Calander + Trello)
